For example, in this scene, it says \"Tour of junkShop\".\n<p>After selecting something, you can open the 'properties' tab to the right of the scene, and change the properties. The elements in the 'tab stops' list can be dragged to any order you like. That's how this tour was made.</p>\n<p>You can change the properties of other objects the same way, including their name and description, and whether or not they appear in the tab list.</p>","iSize" : {"x" : 1,"y" : 0,"z" : 1},"materials" : ["WOQnyDQt89mCYD5EIVNt_CcV1uA.png"],"nametag" : "Create a Tour.","type" : "Plane"}
